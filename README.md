# Qmi8658c
## Overview

The QMI8658C Arduino library provides a convenient interface for working with the QMI8658C inertial measurement unit (IMU) on Arduino platforms. The library is designed to simplify the process of reading and interpreting data from the QMI8658C IMU, making it easier for developers to integrate motion sensing capabilities into their projects.
